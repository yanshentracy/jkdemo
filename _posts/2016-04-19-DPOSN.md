<ul>
<li>Designed a privacy-preserving collaborative filtering mechanism to protect usersâ€™ rating history, adopting the social information to achieve a fine-grained privacy protection.</li>
<li>Used the differential privacy method to provide a rigorous protection.</li>
<li>Compared with the state-of-the-art privacy-preserving mechanism, the proposed algorithm outperforms in both the quality of recommendations and the resistance to the inference attack.</li>
</ul>
